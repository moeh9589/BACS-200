            What makes a hero?  A hero is someone that we look up to.
            Heroes embody what we truly value most.  Therefore who we select as
            role models says a lot about who we are as people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
            <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
In the history of sports, no one has exemplified the amount of humility and courageous as Mariano Rivera. Known for his wicked cut-fastball, he became one of the best pitchers to ever play the sport of baseball. It is arguable that he is the best of all time. After all, he is the only unanimous decision for the baseball hall of fame. Throughout the years, even in the rivalry games, he never showed any disrespect to any of the other players. He was always calm and collected, and he never tried to be someone he wasn't. That is why he is one of the greatest of all time and my inspiration.

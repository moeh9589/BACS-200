# BACS-200

Disc golf is a sport that not a lot of people know about or care enough to go out and try. My goal through this website is to spread 
awareness about the sport and educate people about the sport. There is so much that people don't know about disc golf, like the fact
that each disc has a different behavior, and each disc has a different weight and shape. I will create a page where people can have access
to information about discs, have information about tournaments, receive instruction, have information about practicing at home, and have 
information about the rules.

Every site tells a story. I want this site to tell the story about something that not a lot of poeple know about but has so much beauty 
hidden within.

For this site, I will need to learn more about the rules, and find updated information about the PDGA tournament schedule, pending updates
from the COVID-19 situation.

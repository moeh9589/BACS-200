                    <p>General Frequently Asked Questions
                        <h2>Q. What is #iGiveCatholic?</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>#iGiveCatholic is an online giving event that provides our Catholic parishes, schools, and nonprofit ministries the opportunity to connect with their current donors and establish relationships with new donors.

                            It is also an opportunity for Catholics to affirm our faith as disciples of Jesus Christ by sharing our gifts out of love for God and one another. The goal of #iGiveCatholic is to inspire the Catholic community to come together as faithful stewards and to "Give Catholic" on #GivingTuesday, a global day dedicated to giving back.</p>

                        <h2>Q. Who can participate in the #iGiveCatholic Giving Day?</h2>
                    <hr>
                        <p>Parishes, schools, and nonprofit ministries affiliated with a participating diocese are eligible to participate in the #iGiveCatholic Giving Day. Please consult your dioceses’ point person for more information.</p>

                        <h2>When is #iGiveCatholic?</h2>
                    <hr>

                        <p>This year, #iGiveCatholic takes place on Tuesday, December 3, from 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM CST.</p>
                        <h2>Q. How does it work?</h2>
                    <hr>
                        <p>#iGiveCatholic is an online platform with searchable profiles of participating parishes, schools, and nonprofit ministries from participating dioceses. All donations will be processed through iGiveCatholic.org. Anyone can donate to his or her favorite ministry on Tuesday, December 3, from midnight until 11:59 PM CST. Participating organizations and donors can track event progress via leaderboards.</p>


                        <h2>Q. Why host a day of Catholic giving on #GivingTuesday?</h2>
                    <hr>
                        <p>We have a day for giving thanks, or Thanksgiving. We have two days for purchasing gifts for loved ones – Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And now we have #GivingTuesday, a global day dedicated to giving back out of gratitude for all we have received.

                            On Tuesday, December 3, 2019, individuals and organizations around the world will come together for one common purpose: To celebrate generosity, live generously and to give.

                            For Catholics, generosity and giving have a profound meaning. As we reflect with grateful hearts on how blessed we are, we naturally want to give back to God from our deep sense of gratitude. Compelled to action by our grateful compassion, we unite on this #iGiveCatholic giving day, sharing what we have to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, give shelter to the homeless, and preserve our Catholic heritage for future generations.</p>

                        <h2>Q. How do I register my organization to participate?</h2>
                    <hr>
                        <p>Eligible organizations in participating dioceses must activate their account online by logging onto iGiveCatholic.org via the email confirmation sent from GiveGab on August 19.

                            In this email, you will find a prompt that will allow you to access your #iGiveCatholic “Admin Dashboard” on GiveGab to begin customizing your #iGiveCatholic profile. Be sure to select the prompt in your email to properly activate your account!

                            Online registration will close October 31. #iGiveCatholic utilizes an “opt-out” format. If an organization does not wish to participate in the giving day, please let your diocese’s point person know ASAP or by that date.

                            Questions? How-to articles on registering and completing your profile are located on the Resources page and throughout GiveGab's support center. We also recommend utilizing the blue chat bubble in the bottom right-hand corner of the web page.</p>

                        <p>Two live training webinars will be offered on August 27 and November 5 at 2:00 pm CST.

We strongly advise that you participate in or view these webinars as they will help guide you in a successful giving day. Additional training might be offered by participating dioceses. Please consult your diocesan contact person for more information.</p>


                        <h2>Q. When will my organization receive its donations?</h2>
                    <hr>
                        <p>If you indicate a bank account number in your online registration profile, your organization will receive all donations via ACH distribution within 5 business days. If your organization is being sponsored by your diocese, meaning you do not have a viable bank account with which to receive funds via ACH or your diocese has indicated that it will accept donations for disbursement to its participating organizations, you will be sent your donations via check within 60 days of the giving day.</p>
